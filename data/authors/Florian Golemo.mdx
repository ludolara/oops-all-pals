I'm a postdoc in robotics and 3D perception at Mila / McGill University in Montreal ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.
My goal is to develop useful low-cost robotic assistants that understand their surroundings.
I'm into electronics, shitty robots, game development and indie games, 3D printing, electronic music, bouldering, board games, web dev, and TTRPGs.
