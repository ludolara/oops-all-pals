I'm a highly motivated machine learning researcher passionate about the intersection between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, specifically about investigating the reasoning and few-shot capabilities of Foundation Models (e.g. GPT-3, OPT, etc.), especially when paired with smaller retrieval-style models. I am also passionate about promoting entrepreneurship and design thinking education, at both the secondary and tertiary level.
